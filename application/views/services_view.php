        <br />
        Once you are completely satisfied with the plans, we start the building consent drawing for the council. Any engineering specifications that maybe required are done at this stage.<br />

        <br />
        You then make the change on the plan, scan and email it back to us. We implement your changes and make suggestions. The second draft is then returned to you within two days. This process is repeated and you see your ideas take more shape every time. We will also be available on Skype conversations on TDZ Info.<br />
        <br />
        Once the process is completed and you are happy with the prelim plans we will proceed with th consent Drawings.<br />
        <br />
        At this stage we will require a deposit from you. The consent drawing should be completed within 10 working days and be ready to submit to council. The balance of the quoted price is then payable.<br />
        <br />
        The process should be completed in three rounds of changes. There after we will charge an hourly rate, for the changes.
